After saving Arendelle from destruction and discovering the truth about their family's past, Elsa and Anna had finally found peace with each other. Elsa had embraced her role as the fifth spirit, and Anna had become a true leader in her own right.

As they stood atop the cliff overlooking Arendelle, Elsa turned to Anna with a small smile. "I'm proud of you," she said, her voice soft.

Anna smiled back at her sister. "I'm proud of you too," she replied. "You saved us all."

Elsa nodded, her gaze fixed on the horizon. "But I couldn't have done it without you," she said, her voice growing slightly hoarse. "You're the bravest person I know."

Anna stepped closer to Elsa, feeling the familiar warmth of their sisterly bond wash over her. "We make a pretty good team, don't we?" she said, grinning.

Elsa chuckled softly, turning to face Anna. "The best," she said, reaching out to take Anna's hand. "I don't know what I'd do without you."

Anna squeezed Elsa's hand, feeling a lump form in her throat. "You'll never have to find out," she said, her voice filled with determination.

For a moment, they simply stood there, looking out over their kingdom, their hands clasped together. Then Elsa turned to Anna, a serious look on her face. "Anna," she said, her voice low. "There's something I need to tell you."

Anna furrowed her brow in concern. "What is it?" she asked.

Elsa took a deep breath. "I don't know what the future holds," she said, her voice trembling slightly. "But I want you to know that I love you, and I always will. You're my family, and nothing will ever change that."

Tears pricked at the corners of Anna's eyes as she looked at her sister. "I love you too, Elsa," she said, her voice breaking. "You're my sister, and my best friend, and nothing will ever change that either."

They hugged each other tightly, feeling the warmth of each other's embrace. For a moment, it felt like nothing else in the world mattered, as long as they had each other. And they both knew that, no matter what the future held, they would always be there for each other.
